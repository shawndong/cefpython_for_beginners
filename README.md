# cefpython_for_beginners

When I tried to build my Python desktop program through a web interface, I discovered cefpython.

However, due to a lack of experience in both CEF and web development, it took one or two days to try and basically understand some of the ideas of cefpython.

So I have written some small programs in the hope of providing some help to beginners of cefpython and helping them enter the development of cefpython as soon as possible.
