# cefpython_for_beginners

When I tried to build my Python desktop program through a web interface, I discovered cefpython.

However, due to a lack of experience in both CEF and web development, it took me two days to try and basically understand some of the ideas of cefpython.

So I have written some small programs in the hope of providing some help to beginners of cefpython and helping them enter the development of cefpython as soon as possible.

Codes run in a Windows environment.
